      <br>As global temperatures continue to soar, extreme heat poses numerous health risks, some of which are visible on our skin. Understanding how heat affects your skin can help you take measures to prevent or ease many skin conditions that are sparked or worsened by high temperatures.</summary>  <br> <strong>How does heat affect your skin?</strong> <br> 
        Heat waves can provoke or worsen several skin conditions. <br> <br> <br>
        
        &#x2022; <em>Heat rash</em> (miliaria) occurs due to obstruction of sweat ducts on the skin, which are responsible for helping the body maintain a normal temperature by releasing water to the surface of the skin. As these sweat glands get blocked with excessive sweat on an extremely hot day, they do not function properly and red itchy bumps develop. <br> <br>
        &#x2022;Grover disease, a rash of small, red, itchy bumps on the chest and back, can also be triggered or worsened by excessive heat and sweating. Often this clears up within a few weeks or months. Less often symptoms may persist for years, with flares during the summer months.
        Eczema is a chronic skin condition characterized by dry, itchy plaques that affects millions of people in the United States. Increased sweating during heat waves can lead to skin irritation and inflammation, aggravating eczema symptoms. Dehydration caused by fluid loss through sweating can make the skin more susceptible to eczema flare-ups. <br> <br>
        &#x2022;Rosacea, which causes facial redness, visible blood vessels, and acne-like bumps, is also heat-sensitive. Heat causes blood vessels to dilate as the body attempts to cool itself, resulting in visible redness and flushing. High temperatures, especially combined with sun exposure, can cause flare ups.
        Melasma. Hyperpigmentation disorders like melasma also worsen with heat. Melasma is characterized by irregular dark patches on the face and is often triggered by UV exposure from the sun. Heat can increase the activity of melanocytes, the cells that produce pigment, making these patches more pronounced. Additionally, the combined effects of heat and UV radiation accelerate collagen and elastin degradation, leading to premature aging and loss of skin elasticity. <br> <br>
        &#x2022;Skin cancer risk rises with increased exposure to UV radiation. Heat waves — now beginning earlier, ending later, and lasting longer — contribute to UV exposure, particularly among people who work outdoors. And preliminary research suggests prolonged exposure to high temperatures may further boost skin cancer risk. This could be of particular concern for firefighters, who face extended exposure to extreme heat.
        Heat waves, air pollution, and skin <br> <br>
        &#x2022; During heat waves, levels of environmental pollutants like ozone and particulate matter can rise. And reactions between these pollutants, heat, and UV radiation spawn secondary pollutants such as peroxyacetyl nitrates (PANs). Pollutants like these can irritate the skin and contribute to inflammation through oxidative stress and DNA damage, so inflammatory conditions such as eczema and rosacea may worsen. <br> <br>
        
         <strong>Can heat affect medications?</strong> <br> <br> <br>
         &#x2022; High temperatures compromise the effectiveness of certain medications. For instance, EpiPens, which are crucial for managing life-threatening allergic reactions, can lose their potency when exposed to high temperatures. Check the instructions on all of your medicines to see which ones should be stored in a cool, dry place or refrigerated. If you're not sure which medicines might be affected by heat, talk to your pharmacist or doctor. <br> <br>
        
         &#x2022; Retinoids in skin care products, antibiotics taken for acne, and immunomodulators for autoimmune diseases can make skin more susceptible to sun damage. This can lead to severe sunburns or rashes known as photodermatoses. If you experience this, contact your health care team for advice. <br> <br>
        
         &#x2022; Protect your skin when temperatures climb
        Keep skin cool
        Wear light, breathable clothing. Choose natural fibers like cotton and linen to help regulate body temperature and prevent sweat-induced skin issues. Avoid synthetic fabrics, which can trap heat and moisture.
        Take cool baths or showers. Use cool or tepid water to bathe. Avoid hot showers, which can strip the skin of natural oils, leading to dryness and irritation.
        Find cool spaces. If your home is not air-conditioned, seek out cooler places and ways to cool off during heat waves. <br> <br>
        &#x2022;Keep skin hydrated 
        Drink ample water and eat water-rich foods. Foods like watermelon and cucumbers can provide additional hydration.
        Moisturize your skin. Apply light, non-comedogenic moisturizers immediately after bathing. Look for ingredients such as hyaluronic acid and glycerin, which are beneficial for enhancing skin hydration.
        Limit exposure to sun and pollution <br> <br>
        &#x2022;Use protective clothing. Wear wide-brimmed hats, UV-blocking sunglasses, and long-sleeved shirts to shield the skin from harmful radiation. <br> <br>
        &#x2022; Wear sunscreen. Apply broad-spectrum mineral sunscreens containing zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, or iron oxide to protect against UV radiation and pollutants.
        Use topical antioxidants. Use products like vitamin C in your morning skin care routine to mitigate oxidative stress. <br> <br>
        &#x2022; Wash up. Cleansing face and body at the end of the day may help you limit skin exposure to pollutants while also rinsing off any sunscreen residue. </details> <br> <br>

            <summary><strong style="font-size: 48px;">A fresh look at risks for developing young-onset dementia</strong> <br> Young-onset dementia, which occurs in people younger than age 65, is uncommon. A new study has identified 15 factors linked to a higher risk of young-onset dementia.  </summary>   <br>

            Let's see what they found, and — most importantly — what you can do to reduce your own risks. <br>  <br>

<strong> Are early dementia and young-onset dementia the same?</strong> <br> <br>
No. Experts think of early dementia as the first stage in dementia. Mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia are forms of early dementia. So, someone age 50, 65, or 88 could have early dementia. <br> <br>

Young-onset dementia refers to the age at which dementia is diagnosed. A person has young-onset dementia if symptoms and diagnosis occur before age 65. br <br>

 <strong>What has previous research shown?</strong> <br><br>
A previous study of men in Sweden identified some risk factors for young-onset dementia, including high blood pressure, stroke, depression, alcohol use disorder, vitamin D deficiency, drug use disorder, and overall cognitive function. <br> <br>

<strong></strong>What to know about the new study </strong> <br> <br>
In the new study, a research team in the Netherlands and the United Kingdom looked at data from the UK Biobank. The biobank follows about half a million individuals in the United Kingdom who were 37 to 73 years old when they first joined the project between 2006 and 2010. Most participants identified as white (89%), and the remaining 11% were described only as "other." Slightly more than half of the participants (54%) were women. <br> <br>

The researchers excluded anyone age 65 or older and people who already had dementia at the start of the study, leaving 356,052 participants for the analyses. Over roughly a decade, 485 participants developed young-onset dementia. The researchers compared participants who did and did not develop young-onset dementia to identify possible risk factors. <br> <br>

 <strong>What did the researchers learn about risks for young-onset dementia?</strong> <br><br>
In reviewing the results, I think it is helpful to group the risk factors into several categories, and then to examine each of them. These risks may act on the brain directly or indirectly. <br><br>

 <strong>Eight factors that we know or strongly suspect cause dementia:</strong> <br> <br>
 &#x2022;Genes: Carrying two apolipoprotein E (APOE) ε4 alleles is a major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease. The risk is thought to be caused by the APOE ε4 protein not clearing amyloid efficiently from the brain. This allows amyloid to accumulate and cause plaques, which starts the cascade to cell death and Alzheimer's disease. <br> <br>
 &#x2022;Being diagnosed with alcohol use disorder (AUD) has been associated with damage to several parts of the brain, including the frontal lobes, which leads to trouble with executive function and working memory. When combined with poor nutrition, AUD also harms small regions connected to the hippocampus that are critical for forming new memories. <br> <br>
 &#x2022;Being socially isolated is a major risk factor for dementia. Although the exact mechanism is unknown, it may be because our brains evolved, in large part, for social interactions. Individuals with fewer social contacts have fewer social interactions, and simply don't use their brains enough to keep them healthy. <br><br>
 &#x2022;Not getting enough vitamin D can lead to more viral infections. A number of studies suggest that certain viral infections increase your risk of dementia. <br><br>
 &#x2022;Not hearing well increases your risk for dementia, as I discussed in a prior post. This is likely because of reduced brain stimulation and reduced social interactions. Using hearing aids lessens that risk.
Previously having had a stroke is a risk factor because strokes damage the brain directly, which can lead to vascular dementia. <br><br>
&#x2022;Having heart disease is a major risk factor for strokes, which can then lead to vascular dementia. <br> <br>
&#x2022;Having diabetes if you're a man can lead to dementia in many different ways. Why only if you're a man? The researchers suggest that it is because middle-aged men are more likely to have a diabetes-related ministrokes than middle-aged women, which can, again, lead to vascular dementia. <br> <br>
<strong> Two factors that reduce cognitive reserve  </strong> <br> <br>
Cognitive reserve can be described as our capacity to think, improvise, and problem-solve even as our brains change with age. These two risk factors make it more likely that dementia symptoms will show up at a younger age. <br> <br>

&#x2022;Having less formal education may affect your familiarity with the items on the pencil-and-paper cognitive tests that are used to diagnose dementia. <br><br>
&#x2022;Having lower socioeconomic status may be related to lower-quality education.
Is every factor identified in the study a clear risk? <br><br>

&#x2022;No, and here's why not: Sometimes research turns up apparent risk factors that might be due to reverse causation. It's possible, for example, that symptoms of impending dementia appear to be risk factors because they become noticeable before obvious dementia is diagnosed. <br><br>

&#x2022;Lower handgrip strength is a sign of frailty, which is often associated with dementia.
No alcohol use is a risk factor because people may stop drinking when they develop memory loss (also known as the "healthy drinker effect" in dementia). <br><br>
&#x2022;Depression is a risk factor because many people get sad when they have trouble remembering or when they are worried about having dementia. <br><br>
&#x2022;Lastly, there are risk factors that could be either a contributing cause or a result of the impending dementia. <br><br>

 <strong>High C-reactive protein is a sign of inflammation.</strong> <br><br>
Orthostatic hypotension is an abnormal drop in blood pressure when a person stands up after lying down or sitting. While this condition can lead to brain damage and dementia, it can also be a result of some types of dementia, such as Parkinson's disease dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies. <br><br>
<strong>What can you do to prevent young-onset dementia? </strong> <br> <br>
Taking these five steps can reduce your risk for developing dementia before age 65: <br><br><br>

&#x2022;Don't drink alcohol in excess. <br>
&#x2022;Seek opportunities to socialize with others regularly. <br>
&#x2022;Make sure that you're getting enough vitamin D. You can make your own vitamin D if your skin (without sunblock) is exposed to sunlight. But in northern climates you might need to take a supplement, especially in the winter. Because <br> &#x2022;vitamin D can interact with other medications, ask your doctor about this option. <br>
&#x2022;Make sure you are hearing well and use hearing aids if you are not. <br>
&#x2022;Exercise regularly, eat a healthy diet, maintain a healthy body weight, and work with your doctor to reduce your risk of strokes, heart disease, and diabetes.

        <details><summary><strong>Parenting isn't easy: Two important skills can help</strong><br>Parenting can be challenging, but childhood and adolescence can be difficult too. How can parents help their kids manage anger, sadness, anxiety, and handle emotionally trying times? Practicing two skills can help both your child and you.</summary>
            They say that parenting is the greatest — and the most challenging — job that many of us will ever land. Life can be tough for kids too, especially when they go through emotionally trying times. <br> <br>

            What can parents do to help their kids manage episodes of anger, sadness, or anxiety triggered by school, siblings, and daily living? Whether you are a parent to an elementary-age child, a tweener ages 8 to 12, or a teenager, practicing two skills can help both you and your child: validation and coping. <br> <br>
            
           <strong> Practicing validation</strong> <br> <br>
            Validation teaches your children that feeling and expressing their emotions is okay. <br><br>
            
            "When parents use validation, they are affirming to their child that it's fine to feel emotions and they should not be suppressed," says Dr. Chase Samsel with the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Harvard-affiliated Boston Children's Hospital. "It shows them you understand their feelings and point of view, and it establishes trust. This, in turn, can help a child feel supported and open to discussing solutions." <br><br><br>
            
            <strong>Start with acknowledgement </strong>
            Acknowledge their emotions with comments like, "It sounds like you are frustrated or angry," or "I can see that you've had a tough day at school." <br> <br>
            
            But which emotion — or emotions — is your child feeling? "It can be difficult for parents to recognize the genuine emotion their child is battling," says Dr. Samsel. "Many times, kids have an emotional reaction but can't explain what's going on, or don't want to, or express various emotions at once." <br> <br>
            
            Other times, different emotions lie underneath the one being shown. This is especially common among teenagers where they display anger, but often the real emotion is fear, anxiety, or sadness. "In these incidences, just recognizing they are going through something difficult is enough," says Dr. Samsel. <br> <br>
            
             <strong> Practice validation often</strong>
            A child may not respond to validation at first — they may not want to talk about their emotions or may ignore your interest. But consistent validation will eventually pay off. <br> <br>
            
            "By repeating validation when emotional crises arise, the child soon will become more comfortable expressing their emotion," says Dr. Samsel. "Once they recognize that their parents welcome this and will not be reprimanded, they will be open to sharing details." <br> <br>
            
             <strong>Building a coping skills toolbox</strong><br> <br> <br>
            Coping skills are ways parents can teach their children to manage emotional problems when they arise. <br> <br>
            
            Try a breathing exercise together <br>
            Breathing exercises are a popular strategy, as they are easy to learn and quick to use. Dr. Samsel recommends any of the following: three-part breathing, ujjayi breathing, and belly breathing. <br> <br>
            
            Other coping skills include guided meditation, visualization, squeezing a ball for stress relief, taking a walk or playing outside, and reading together (ideal for preschool and elementary-age children). <br> <br>
            
            "Sometimes just giving children alone time in their room or "taking space" works well," says Dr. Samsel. <br> <br>
            
            <strong>Tap into coping skills yourself</strong> <br> <br>
            It's also vital for parents to adopt these strategies when dealing with their own emotions, says Dr. Samsel. Not only will this help you feel calmer, but it's a great way to model that coping skills help everyone — adults, too! <br> <br>
            
            For example, try telling your kids when you feel upset or frustrated about something that happens during your day. Announce that you plan to take a walk to de-stress or do a breathing exercise. Later, share your strategies for problem-solving. <br> <br>
            
            "Kids watch what their parents do and will often mimic their behavior," says Dr. Samsel. "If they see you constructively working through your emotions, they will be more open to doing the same." <br> <br>
            
            Be flexible <br>
            Never insist on having older kids use a coping mechanism, even when situations call for it. That could feel like punishment and trigger an automatic resistance. <br> <br>
            
            Instead, Dr. Samsel suggests parents expose their children to different types of coping skills and then let them decide which ones they want to try. "They may need to experiment to find techniques they can easily follow and that work for them," says Dr. Samsel.
